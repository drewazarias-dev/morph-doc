Welcome to Morph’s Developer Docs!

Are you eager to build applications on Morph but unsure where to start? 

You're in the right place – we've got you covered!

![devintro](../../assets/docs/dev/devintro.png)

As the first optimistic zkEVM Ethereum Layer 2 solution, Morph is 100% EVM compatible.

Building on morph is just like building on Ethereum. If you’re experienced in Ethereum development, you'll find your existing code, tooling, and dependencies are fully compatible with Morph.
