## The Open Infrastructure for Onchain Payments

**Morph Rails** is the infrastructure layer for permissionless, programmable payments on the Morph blockchain. It is designed for developers, merchants, and service providers to build custom payment flows, foreign exchange, payroll, invoicing, rewards, and compliance services without needing licenses or platform approval.  

Morph Rails functions like an open, blockchain-based Stripe. It delivers the same flexibility and modularity Stripe offers to Web2 businesses, but in a fully self-custodial, onchain environment where developers can compose secure, compliant payment experiences without relying on centralized processors.  

## Overview

Morph Rails shifts the focus from a closed, consumer-facing app to an open, modular protocol. It is optimized for both 2C (consumer) and 2B (business) use, enabling:  

- Permissionless integration for wallets, apps, and merchants
- Self-custodial payment flows where users and businesses control their own assets
- Modular building blocks for FX, payouts, compliance, and rewards
- Instant settlement and global reach through Morph’s infrastructure


## Key Features

### 1. Permissionless by Design

No licenses, approvals, or gatekeepers. Open infrastructure that anyone can integrate into their products or services.

### 2. Composable and Modular

Build with onchain modules for checkout, FX, recurring billing, payroll, and identity verification. Combine modules to create custom payment experiences in minutes.

### 3. Self-Custodial and Compliance-Ready

Users and merchants hold their own funds at all times. Integrated tools like Sumsub (ID verification) and Chainalysis (transaction monitoring) provide compliance without custody risk.

### 4. Advanced Payment Primitives

Support for group approvals, batch payments, and cross-chain yield routing. Fully transparent, programmable, and executed onchain.

### 5. Multi-Role Support

Works for wallet providers, fintech issuers, DeFi protocols, and merchants. Supports both direct consumer-facing use and behind-the-scenes infrastructure integration.


## Highlights

- Decentralized innovation that allows builders to deploy without platform control or restrictions

- Composability that lets developers mix and match payment, compliance, and rewards modules like Lego bricks

- Reduced risk for builders by avoiding custody and related legal liabilities

- Scalable and cost-efficient on Morph Layer with low gas fees and minimal swap costs

- Expands the Morph ecosystem by attracting more apps, services, and integrations

*An open, self-custodial foundation for blockchain payments that gives developers the same power Stripe gives Web2 businesses.*


## How Morph Rails Fits Into the Ecosystem

Morph Rails is the core infrastructure layer in Morph’s onchain payment ecosystem.  

- Provides the rails that other apps run on

- Enables any wallet, merchant, or developer to plug into the Morph payment network

- Creates a marketplace of modular payment services for builders and enterprises


### Use Cases

- Merchants can accept stablecoin payments that settle instantly to a self-custodial wallet

- Wallets and fintechs can integrate ready-made modules for payments, FX, and compliance
DeFi protocols can add native payments, invoicing, and reward distribution without building from scratch

- Cross-border businesses can use programmable FX and invoicing tools to simplify international transactions
