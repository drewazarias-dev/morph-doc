## What Kind of Rollup is Morph?

Morph uses a hybrid rollup model called "Optimistic zkEVM & RVP". This combines the strengths of both zkRollups and Optimistic Rollups, optimizing for efficiency, cost, and speed. This unique approach places Morph at the cutting edge of rollup technology.

## What Sets Morph Apart from Other Rollups?

Morph stands out with its innovative features:


**State Verification**: The Optimistic zkEVM & RVP method enhances efficiency by combining zkRollups and Optimistic Rollups.

**Efficiency and Cost Reduction**: Morph ensures fast transaction execution and cost-effectiveness while maintaining decentralization.

**Decentralized Sequencer Network**: This pioneering network setup addresses security concerns and ensures robustness at a Layer 1 level.

**Modular Architecture**: Morphâ€™s adaptable and composable architecture fosters a flexible and interactive ecosystem.

## As a Solidity Developer, Will I Notice Differences Deploying on Morph Compared to Ethereum?

Deploying on Morph is very similar to deploying on Ethereum, thanks to its EVM compatibility. Ethereum applications can be migrated to Morph with minimal adjustments. For more detailed guidance, check out the [Development Guides](../build-on-morph/build-on-morph/2-development-setup.md) section.

## The L2 gas price is too high to execute transactions or deploy contracts, what should i do?

The L2 Gas Price you obtained from external resources (eg. RPC) is typically derived from the average or median of confirmed transactions over a certain period. This figure reflects the recommended settings to ensure your transaction gets confirmed, rather than representing the most cost-effective value.

In some cases, certain users may intentionally raise the priority fee (hence the total gas fee) to earn more campaign points, resulting in abnormally high Gas Prices. We recommend that you can reduce your transaction costs by manually setting the L2 Gas Price.

Currently, Morph's L2 Base Fee is **0.001 gwei**, and as long as the number of transactions per block does not reach the limit, you only need to pay the Base Fee to ensure your transaction confirmation, without needing to pay an excess Priority Fee.

Here is a transaction example that only pays the L2 Base Fee and got confirmed:

## How long should I wait for my funds to withdraw from Morph?

Currently, the Morph mainnet has a 48-hour (2 days) challenge window. This means that if you are using our canonical bridge, you need to wait 48 hours (2 days) to receive your funds. There are several third-party bridges that offer a faster withdrawal experience by using a liquidity pool mechanism.

## How do i speed the transaction on Morph?

Same like Ethereum mainnet and any other EIP 1559 chains. If your transaction is pending and not confirmed, you can replace it with a new one that has a higher gas price. This involves sending the same transaction again but with an incrementally higher gas price, using the same nonce as the original.

A lot of the wallet have built in features to help you do this.

## My Transaction is Pending, What Should I Do?

For the testnet, if the priority fee you paid is too low, less than 0.01 gwei, your transaction will not be processed. This is to prevent spam transactions from impacting the whole network. If you encounter this situation, please accelerate your transaction by providing a higher priority fee that meets the requirements.

For the mainnet, this is usually because each block is currently full, so you need to provide a more competitive priority fee to ensure your transaction is confirmed.

Additionally, if your previous transaction has not yet been confirmed, your newly submitted transaction will wait for the previous transaction to be fully confirmed.
